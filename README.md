**Prism** is a diagnostic tool for Soroban that translates complex blockchain errors into clear, actionable insights. By resolving custom contract errors and providing interactive time-travel replays of historical transactions, Prism helps developers identify and fix root causes in seconds.

## Features

- **Instant Error Decoding**: Decodes Soroban host errors into plain English with suggested fixes.
- **Contract-Specific Resolution**: Cross-references WASM metadata to resolve custom error codes (e.g., `#3` → `InsufficientBalance`).
- **Execution Trace Replay**: Replays transactions against historical ledger state for deep inspection.
- **Resource Profiling**: Identifies budget hotspots and expensive host function calls.
- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Supports breakpoints, step-through execution, and "what-if" re-simulation.
- **Multi-Interface Support**: Available via Rust CLI, VS Code Extension, and a Web Application.

## Architecture

Prism is organized as a modular monorepo:

- **Core Library (`crates/core`)**: The shared Rust engine for decoding, replaying, and debugging.
- **CLI (`crates/cli`)**: Powerful command-line interface for terminal-native diagnostics.
- **WASM (`crates/wasm`)**: Core logic compiled to WASM for client-side web integration.
- **Web App (`apps/web`)**: Interactive Next.js 16 dashboard for shareable debug sessions.
- **Server (`apps/server`)**: Async task processor and WebSocket server for trace streaming.

## Tech Stack

- **Core Engine**: Rust (edition 2021)
- **Blockchain**: Stellar Soroban SDK (v21)
- **Web Frontend**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5
- **WASM Processing**: wasmparser & wasm-pack
- **CLI Framework**: Clap & Ratatui (TUI)

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Rust 1.77 or higher.
   - Node.js 20 or higher.
   - pnpm installed.

2. **Clone and Prepare**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prism-soroban/prism.git
   cd Prism
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Build from Source**:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Run the CLI**:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/prism decode <tx-hash>
   ```

- [Error Taxonomy Guide](./docs/error-taxonomy-guide.md)

## Use Cases

### Debugging Failed Transactions

Instantly understand why a mainnet transaction failed without redeploying or adding print statements.

### Resource Optimization

Profile contract execution to identify expensive storage reads or CPU-heavy host function calls before deploying to mainnet.

### Regression Testing

Export failed transactions as standalone test cases to ensure bugs are permanently resolved.
